# DO NOT UPLOAD MY FILES TO OTHER SITES

## A collection of my mods for Assassin's Creed Syndicate

#### Centered Stealth Camera:
This mod keeps the camera centered while in stealth mode.

#### Fov Fix
This mod increases the field of view. 

#### Keep Hood On
This mod allows to keep the hood on in free roam. 

### How to use:

1. Copy the ACS_Launch.exe file and the "Mods" folder to the root game folder.
2. Ensure that the "Mods" folder contains only relevant files.
3. Launch the game by double clicking on ACS_Launch.exe.

The program can be set to close automatically by passing "--close-when-finished" command line argument.

### Notes:

Fov Fix: Use only one preset at the time (low, medium or high).

Keep Hood On: Alpha version. May be buggy, leave visible textures/meshes.
